This project is a training one. Iâ€™m developing it in order to get some experience in JavaScript, Node.js, MySql, HTML and CSS. It is planned as an easy to use bilder for those who create web sites for their own beauty salons.   
Currently, not all planned features are implemented: admin panel and unique content for logged in users are coming soon :)
